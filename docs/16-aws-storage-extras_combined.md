## 1. AWS Snowball ❄️

AWS Snowball is a highly secure and portable device designed for two primary use cases:

*   Collecting and processing data at the edge.
*   Migrating data in and out of AWS.

If you're dealing with petabytes of data for migration, Snowball is worth considering.

### Snowball Edge Devices 📦

There are two main types of Snowball Edge devices:

1.  **Edge Storage Optimized:** Primarily for storage.
2.  **Edge Compute Optimized:** Primarily for compute.

The key difference is their storage capacity:

*   Edge Storage Optimized: 210 TB
*   Edge Compute Optimized: 28 TB

### Data Migrations 🚚

Transferring large datasets over a network can be time-consuming. 📌 **Example:** Transferring 100 TB over a 1 Gbps connection can take 12 days.

|              | **100 Mbps** | **1 Gbps** | **10 Gbps** |
|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| **10 TB**    | 12 days      | 30 hours   | 3 hours     |
| **100 TB**   | 124 days     | 12 days    | 30 hours    |
| **1 PB**     | 3 years      | 124 days   | 12 days     |

Challenges with network data transfer include:

*   Slow connection speeds.
*   Limited connectivity or bandwidth.
*   High network costs.
*   Shared bandwidth with other applications.
*   Unstable connections.

If data transfer takes over a week, consider using a Snowball device.

What is Snowball device? Snowball is a device that is shipped to you, you load your data, and then ship it back to AWS. It's a portable device that can be used for data migrations and edge computing.

**Traditional Upload vs. Snowball**

![Traditional Upload vs. Snowball](img/traditional-upload-vs-snowball.png)

*   Direct upload to Amazon S3: Simple but can consume all your bandwidth.
*   Snowball:
    1.  Receive a physical Snowball device.
    2.  Load the device with your data.
    3.  Ship the device back to AWS.
    4.  AWS imports the data from the Snowball to, for example, an Amazon S3 bucket.

### Edge Computing 🖥️

Snowball can also be used for edge computing, processing data where it's created. 📌 **Example:** Trucks, ships, or mining stations with limited or no internet access.

![Edge Computing Use Cases](img/edge_computing_use_cases.png)

In these scenarios, you can order a Snowball Edge device to perform computations locally. The **Edge Compute Optimized** device is designed for this.

**Capabilities:**

*   Run EC2 instances directly on the device.
*   Execute Lambda functions directly on the device.

**Benefits:**

*   Pre-process data at the edge.
*   Perform machine learning at the edge.
*   Transcode media at the edge.

Once processed, the data can be sent back to AWS.

📝 **Note:** The Snowball service is primarily for data migrations and edge computing.

## 2. AWS Snow Family: Ordering a Snow Device

Let's explore the process of ordering a device from the AWS Snow family. This will give us a good overview of the available options.

First, you'll need to provide some basic information:

*   Job Name: Give your import job a descriptive name. 📌 **Example:** "My Import Job"
*   Job Type: Select the type of job you want to perform. The main options are:
    *   Import into Amazon S3: 📦 Amazon ships a Snowball device to you, you load your data, and then ship it back to AWS.
    *   Export from Amazon S3: 📤 Data is exported from your Amazon S3 buckets onto a Snowball device, which is then shipped to you.
    *   Local Compute and Storage Only: 💻 Use the device for edge computing tasks.

Let's assume we choose "Import from Amazon S3".

Next, you'll select the specific Snow device you need. Available options may vary, but here are a couple of examples:

*   Snowball Edge Storage Optimized: Offers a large storage capacity (e.g., 210 TB).
*   Snowball Edge Compute Optimized: Designed for compute-intensive tasks at the edge.

📝 **Note:** The specific devices available may change over time. The key is to understand the general concept of the Snow family.

After selecting the device, you'll configure the pricing and data transfer details:

*   Pricing Option: Choose between on-demand per-day pricing.
*   Storage Transfer: Configure S3 data transfer settings.
*   Buckets: Specify the S3 buckets you want to transfer data into. 📌 **Example:** Select the bucket where you want the data to be imported.

Then, configure security settings:

*   Encryption: Choose how you want to encrypt your data.
*   Service Access: Select a service role that grants the Snow device the necessary permissions to access your S3 buckets. This is crucial for the device to write data to your S3 buckets.

    ```text
    IAM Role -> Allows Snow Device to write to S3
    ```

Shipping information is next:

*   Shipping Address: Provide the address where you want the Snow device to be shipped.
*   Shipping Speed: Choose your preferred shipping speed (e.g., one-day or two-day shipping).
*   Notifications: Configure notifications to track the status of your job.

Finally, review the job summary.

Once the job is created, you'll receive a Snowball Edge device. Load your data onto the device and then ship it back to AWS using the provided shipping label.

That's a high-level overview of how the Snow family works! We won't actually order a device in this example, but hopefully, this gives you a good understanding of the process.

## 3. Snowball to Glacier Data Import

This section covers a common scenario that might appear in the exam. The goal is to import data from Snowball directly into Glacier.

Unfortunately, Snowball cannot directly import data into Glacier. ⚠️ **Warning:** This is a key limitation to remember.

![Snowball to Glacier Data Import](img/snowball-to-glacier-data-import.png)

The solution involves a two-step process using Amazon S3 as an intermediary:

1.  **Snowball Import:** Use Snowball to import the data into Amazon S3. 📦
2.  **Lifecycle Policy:** Create an S3 lifecycle policy to transition the objects from S3 into Amazon Glacier. 🔄

Here's a summary:

*   Snowball imports data into Amazon S3.
*   An S3 lifecycle policy automatically moves the data to Amazon Glacier.

💡 **Tip:** Understanding S3 lifecycle policies is crucial for cost optimization and data management.

📝 **Note:** Remember this workflow for the exam! It's a simple but important concept.

---

## 4. Amazon FSx

## 6. AWS Storage Gateway

AWS is increasingly focusing on hybrid cloud solutions. Hybrid cloud means:- 
- A portion of your infrastructure resides on AWS
- While the remainder stays on-premises. 
 
This setup can stem from various reasons:
*   Long cloud migration processes.
*   Specific security 
*   Compliance needs
*   A IT strategic decision to use the cloud only for elastic workloads, keeping core operations on-premises.

S3 is a proprietary storage solution (unlike EFS/NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premises.

AWS Storage Gateway acts as a bridge between your on-premises data and your AWS cloud storage.

### Cloud Native Storage Options on AWS

AWS offers several cloud-native storage options:

*   Block Storage: Amazon EBS, EC2 Instance Store.
*   File Systems: Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx.
*   Object Storage: Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier.

### What is AWS Storage Gateway? 🌉

AWS Storage Gateway bridges on-premises data with cloud storage. While seemingly simple, it supports diverse use cases:

*   Disaster Recovery: Backing up on-premises data to the cloud.
*   Backup and Restore: Facilitating cloud migration.
*   Storage Extension: Expanding on-premises storage to the cloud.
*   Low-Latency Access: Using the gateway as an on-premises cache for data primarily stored on AWS.

### Types of Storage Gateways

There are several types of Storage Gateways, each designed for specific scenarios:

1.  S3 File Gateway
2.  Volume Gateway
3.  Tape Gateway

> Note: FSx File Gateway was also there but it has been **discontinued by AWS**. You can assume it will not appear at the exam after June 2025.

Let's examine each in detail.

### 1. Amazon S3 File Gateway 🗄️

![Amazon S3 File Gateway](img/amazon-s3-file-gateway.png)

The S3 File Gateway connects an S3 bucket to an on-premises application server using standard network file systems.

*   It supports various S3 storage classes (S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Intelligent-Tiering), but not Glacier directly.
*   It allows application servers to use NFS or SMB protocols.
*   Behind the scenes, the gateway translates these requests into HTTPS requests for Amazon S3.
*   To the application server, it appears as a normal file share.

📌 **Example:** Exposing S3 objects to on-premises application servers.

You can archive objects by creating a lifecycle policy for your S3 bucket to transition objects to S3 Glacier.

Any buckets configured with the S3 File Gateway are accessible via NFS and SMB. **The most recently used data is cached in the file gateway for faster access.**

📝 **Note:** Only the most recently used files are cached, not the entire S3 bucket.

- It supports different storage classes, including S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering. 
- Transition to S3 Glacier is also supported using lifecycle policies.

To access your bucket, you need to create IAM roles for each file gateway. If using SMB protocol (which is native to Windows), there's integration with Active Directory (AD) for user authentication.

### 2. Volume Gateway 💾

The Volume Gateway provides block storage using the iSCSI protocol, backed by Amazon S3. Volumes are backed up by EBS snapshots, which can be used to restore on-premises volumes.

![Volume Gateway](img/volume-gateway.png)

There are two types of Volume Gateway:

*   Cached Volumes: Provide low-latency access to the most recent data. Your primary data is stored in Amazon S3 while your frequently accessed data is retained locally in the cache for low-latency access.
*   Stored Volumes: The entire dataset is on-premises, with scheduled backups to Amazon S3. Your entire dataset is stored locally while also being asynchronously backed up to Amazon S3.

The primary goal of the Volume Gateway is to back up volumes from your on-premises servers. The Volume Gateway creates Amazon EBS snapshots backed by Amazon S3.

### 3. Tape Gateway 📼

![Tape Gateway](img/tape-gateway.png)

The Tape Gateway is designed for companies using tape backup systems. It backs up virtual tapes to the cloud.

*   The virtual tape library (VTL) is backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier.
*   It uses existing tape-based processes and the iSCSI interface.
*   It works with leading backup software vendors.

The Tape Gateway interfaces with the cloud by storing tapes in Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier.

### Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance ⚙️

![Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance](https://webobjects2.cdw.com/is/image/CDW/6854598?product-detail$)

From all the above gateway diagrams, we have seen that they run on-premises. The gateway typically runs within your corporate data center. If you lack virtual servers to run the gateway, you can use the Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance.

*   It's a physical appliance that you can order on Amazon.
*   Once installed, it can be configured as a File Gateway, Volume Gateway, or Tape Gateway.
*   It provides sufficient CPU, memory, network, and SSD cache resources.

📌 **Example:** Useful for daily NFS backups in small data centers without virtualization.

### Storage Gateway Summary 📝

![Storage Gateway Summary](img/storage-gateway-summary.png)

Here's a summary of the Storage Gateway service:

*   **On-Premises:** Deploy a Storage Gateway VM or Hardware Appliance.
*   **Storage Gateway Service:** The core service managing the connection.
*   **AWS Cloud:** The destination for your data.

**Use Cases:**

*   **File Gateway (S3):** User group file shares accessed over NFS or SMB, backed by Amazon S3 (excluding Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive initially, but lifecycle policies can transition data to Glacier).
*   **Volume Gateway:** Application servers mount volumes over iSCSI, with data stored in Amazon S3 and potentially transformed into AWS EBS volumes for restoration on AWS.
*   **Tape Gateway:** Backup applications connect over iSCSI VTL to a Tape Gateway, which stores data in Amazon S3 as a tape library, with the option to transition tapes to Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive.
---

## 7. Storage Gateway Hands-On

Let's explore the different types of Storage Gateways available in AWS. 📝 **Note:** You don't need to know how to configure these for the exam, just the different types.

We can create a gateway and see the four main options:

*   Amazon S3 File Gateway
*   Volume Gateway
*   Tape Gateway

### Amazon S3 File Gateway 🗄️

The Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a local cache for Amazon S3 on-premises, storing your most recently used data. This is the primary purpose of this gateway.

When configuring, you have several platform options:

*   On-premises virtualization platforms (VMware, Hyper-V, Linux KVM)
*   Amazon EC2 (⚠️ **Warning:** This removes some of the caching benefits)
*   Hardware appliance (ordered directly from AWS)

The hardware appliance is particularly useful as you can hook it into your data center and run a file gateway.

### Volume Gateway 💾

The Volume Gateway offers two distinct options:

1.  **Cached Volume:** Provides low-latency access to your most recently used data for your storage volumes. Your primary data is stored in Amazon S3 while your frequently accessed data is retained locally in the cache for low-latency access.
2.  **Stored Volume:** Keeps your on-premise data with scheduled offsite backups. Your entire dataset is stored locally while also being asynchronously backed up to Amazon S3.

These are two very different use cases, and it's important to understand the differences for the exam.

The Volume Gateway uses block storage in Amazon S3 and point-in-time backups as EBS snapshots, effectively creating volumes.

### Tape Gateway 📼

The Tape Gateway allows you to backup your data into Amazon S3 and archive it into Glacier. It uses your existing tape-based processes and the same protocols you're familiar with in your Virtual Tape Library (VTL).

---

## 8. AWS Transfer Family

The AWS Transfer Family allows you to transfer data in and out of Amazon S3 or EFS without directly using the S3 APIs or the EFS network file system. Instead, you can use standard file transfer protocols.

It supports the following protocols:

*   AWS Transfer for FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
*   FTPS (File Transfer Protocol over SSL - encrypted)
*   SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)

📝 **Note:** FTP is unencrypted, while FTPS and SFTP provide encryption during data transfer.

Using these protocols, you can upload data to S3 or EFS. The Transfer Family provides a fully managed, scalable, reliable, and highly available infrastructure.

### Pricing

You are charged based on:

*   Per provisioned endpoint per hour.
*   A fee per gigabyte of data transferred in and out of the Transfer Family.

### User Authentication

You have options for managing user credentials:

*   Store and manage credentials within the Transfer Family service itself.
*   Integrate with existing authentication systems such as:
    *   Microsoft Active Directory
    *   LDAP
    *   Okta
    *   Amazon Cognito
    *   Any custom source

### Use Cases

The primary use case is to provide an FTP interface to Amazon S3 or EFS for:

*   Sharing files
*   Sharing public datasets
*   CRM and ERP systems

### Architecture

![Transfer Family Architecture](img/transfer-family-architecture.png)

The Transfer Family has three protocol options. Users access the service through endpoints using FTP, FTPS, or SFTP.

Optionally, you can use Amazon Route 53 to provide your own hostname for the FTP service.

The Transfer Family service (e.g., Transfer for FTP) assumes an IAM role to read and write files to Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS. This process is transparent.

To secure the Transfer Family services, you can authenticate users using an external authentication system like Active Directory or LDAP.

---

## 9. AWS DataSync

AWS DataSync is a service used to synchronize data between various locations. It's important to understand its core functionality for the exam. This topic is asked frequently in the exam.

The main idea is to move large amounts of data to and from different places, including:

*   On-premises locations - Agent needed
*   Other cloud locations - Agent needed
*   Between AWS services (AWS to AWS - Different Storage service - no agent needed)

To connect to on-premises servers or other cloud locations, DataSync uses protocols like NFS, SMB, and HDFS.

*   An agent is required to run on-premises or in the other cloud environment to facilitate this connection.

DataSync can synchronize data to:

*   Amazon S3 (including all storage classes, even Glacier)
*   Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
*   Amazon FSx (all supported file systems)

📝 **Note:** Replication tasks are not continuous; they are scheduled. You can configure DataSync to run hourly, daily, or weekly. There will be a lag, but the data will be synchronized according to the schedule.

**DataSync preserves file permissions and metadata**, including security settings. This ensures compliance with NFS POSIX file systems and SMB permissions.

📌 **Example:** This is often the only option that preserves file metadata when moving data between locations, which is a key point for the exam.

A single DataSync agent can be quite powerful:

*   It can run one task at a time.
*   It can use up to 10 gigabits of data per second.
*   You can set bandwidth limits to avoid maxing out your network.

### DataSync Architecture

![DataSync Architecture](img/data-sync-architecture.png)

Consider the use case of synchronizing on-premises files (using SMB or NFS) to AWS (S3, EFS, or FSx).

1.  You have your on-premises environment and your AWS region where DataSync is running.
2.  You have your NFS or SMB server on-premises.
3.  Install the AWS DataSync agent on-premises and configure it to connect to your NFS or SMB server.
4.  The DataSync agent establishes a connection and connects in an encrypted fashion to the DataSync service.
5.  From there, you can direct the data to any storage class in Amazon S3, AWS EFS, or Amazon FSx.

The synchronization can be one-way (on-premises to AWS) or bi-directional (AWS back to on-premises).

### Using AWS Snowcone with DataSync

> Sometime in exam, will say wants to use DataSync but lacks sufficient network capacity in that case we can use AWS Snowcone.

If you lack sufficient network capacity for DataSync, consider using AWS Snowcone.

*   The Snowcone device comes with the DataSync agent pre-installed.
*   Run Snowcone on-premises to pull your data using the DataSync agent.
*   Ship the Snowcone device back to your AWS region.
*   Synchronize the data to your AWS storage resources.

### Synchronizing Between AWS Storage Services

![DataSync Between AWS Storage Services](img/data-sync-between-aws-storage-services.png)

DataSync can also synchronize data between different AWS storage services, such as:

*   Amazon S3
*   Amazon EFS
*   Amazon FSx

Data can be moved between any of these services.

Again, the AWS DataSync service copies both the data and the metadata between the different AWS storage services. This is a crucial point and may appear on the exam.

### Key Takeaways

To reiterate:

*   DataSync can synchronize data between various locations.
*   Synchronization is not continuous; it's a scheduled task (hourly, daily, weekly).
*   DataSync preserves metadata and file permissions.
*   You need to run DataSync agents when connecting to an NFS or SMB server.
