## 1. Other Services Overview

This section is a bit special because we'll be covering technologies that might appear in one or two very basic exam questions. 📝 **Note:** This lecture is an overview, not a deep dive.

As the exam evolves, I'll add more detailed lectures to this section as needed. 📌 **Example:** If a new service becomes prominent, I'll create a dedicated lecture.

Everything you need to know for now is included here. I guarantee it! 👍

Let's get started and explore these other services. 🚀

## 2. Deploying and Managing Infrastructure at Scale: CloudFormation

In this section, we'll explore different methods for deploying your workloads onto AWS, starting with CloudFormation.

CloudFormation is a crucial technology in AWS because it provides a declarative way of defining your AWS infrastructure for almost all resources.

📌 **Example:** In CloudFormation, you can define:

*   A security group
*   Two EC2 instances using that security group
*   An S3 bucket
*   A load balancer in front of all the machines

CloudFormation then automatically creates all these resources in the correct order and with the specified configurations.

**AWS CloudFormation** can be seen as an **alternative** to **Terraform**, but the choice depends on your use case. Here’s how they compare:

| Feature              | AWS CloudFormation ✅                                     | Terraform ✅                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Provider**         | Native AWS service                                       | HashiCorp (open source + enterprise)                                           |
| **Scope**            | AWS-only (with some custom extensions)                   | Multi-cloud + on-prem + SaaS                                                   |
| **Language**         | YAML / JSON                                              | HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)                                         |
| **Integration**      | Deep AWS integration (IAM, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, etc.) | Supports thousands of providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Databases, SaaS) |
| **State Management** | Managed by AWS (no manual state files)                   | Requires state management (local or remote backends like S3, Terraform Cloud)  |
| **Cost**             | Free (only pay for AWS resources)                        | Free OSS, with optional paid Terraform Cloud/Enterprise                        |
| **Learning Curve**   | More verbose, AWS-specific                               | Easier to read, modular, reusable                                              |
| **Lock-in**          | High (AWS-only)                                          | Low (works across providers)                                                   |
| **Best for**         | AWS-only environments needing tight AWS integration      | Multi-cloud, hybrid setups, vendor-neutral deployments                         |

👉 **Bottom line:**

* Choose **CloudFormation** if you are **fully AWS-focused**.
* Choose **Terraform** if you need **multi-cloud flexibility** or want to avoid vendor lock-in.

### Benefits of Using CloudFormation

There are several advantages to using CloudFormation:

*   **Infrastructure as Code:** 💻 All your infrastructure is defined as code. This means you avoid manual resource creation, which enhances control. Any changes to your AWS cloud infrastructure must undergo code review, promoting a robust operational model.
*   **Cost Advantage:** 💰 Each resource within a CloudFormation stack is tagged, allowing for easy cost estimation and management.
*   **Saving Strategy:** 📉 You can automate the deletion of templates (and their associated resources) during off-peak hours (e.g., deleting at 5:00 PM and recreating at 8:00 AM) to save costs.
*   **Easy Resource Management:** 🚀 CloudFormation makes it easy to create and delete resources, aligning with core cloud principles.

### Productivity Enhancements

CloudFormation offers several productivity benefits:

*   **On-the-Fly Infrastructure Management:** ⚙️ You can quickly destroy and recreate infrastructure.
*   **Diagram Generation:** 📊 CloudFormation can generate diagrams of your templates.
*   **Declarative Programming:** ✨ You don't need to worry about the order in which resources are created (e.g., DynamoDB table vs. EC2 instance). CloudFormation intelligently handles dependencies.

### Leveraging Existing Resources

With CloudFormation, you don't have to start from scratch:

*   **Existing Templates:** 📚 You can leverage existing templates available online.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** 📖 Extensive documentation is available.
*   **Broad AWS Resource Support:** ✅ CloudFormation supports almost all AWS resources.
*   **Custom Resources:** 🛠️ For unsupported resources, you can use custom resources.

CloudFormation is the foundation of infrastructure as code on AWS.

### Visualizing CloudFormation Templates

You can visualize CloudFormation templates using the Infrastructure Composer service.

![Visualizing CloudFormation Templates](./img/Visualizing-CloudFormation-Templates.png)

📌 **Example:** Visualizing a WordPress CloudFormation stack allows you to see:

*   ALB Listener
*   Database security group
*   SQL database
*   Different security groups
*   Launch configuration
*   Application balancers

You can also see the relationships between these components, which is helpful for understanding your architecture.

### Exam Perspective

From an exam perspective, remember that CloudFormation is used when:

*   You need infrastructure as code.
*   You need to repeat an architecture across different environments, regions, or AWS accounts.

## 3. CloudFormation Introduction

This note provides a quick introduction to CloudFormation and an overview of how it works. We'll cover creating and updating stacks using templates.

### Creating a Stack

1.  **Region Selection**: ⚠️ **Warning:** Ensure you are in the **US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1** region. The provided template is specifically designed for this region due to Availability Zone and AMI ID constraints.

2.  **Template Preparation**:
    *   Multiple options exist for template creation:
        *   Choose an existing template.
        *   Use a sample template.
        *   Build from Application Composer.
    *   For this demo, we'll select:- 
        * Prepare Template: Choose an existing template.
        * Template Source: Upload a template file.

3.  **Template File**:
    *   The template file is located in your course code under `CloudFormation/0-just-EC2.yaml`.
    *   📌 **Example:** The `0-just-EC2.yaml` file contains:

        ```yaml
        ---
        Resources:
            MyInstance:
                Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
                Properties:
                AvailabilityZone: us-east-1a
                ImageId: ami-0453ec754f44f9a4a
                InstanceType: t2.micro
        ```

    *   📝 **Note:**  The template defines how to launch an EC2 instance. The `ImageId` (AMI ID) is region-specific, and the `AvailabilityZone` is `us-east-1a`, hence the region requirement.

4.  **Uploading the Template**: Select the `0-just-EC2.yaml` file to upload.

5.  **Application Composer**:
    *   You can view the template in Application Composer for a visual representation.
    *   Application Composer provides a canvas showing the resources defined in your template.
    *   You can switch between YAML and JSON formats.
    *   Double-clicking components in the canvas provides more details.

6.  **Stack Details**:
    *   Provide a stack name (e.g., "demo CloudFormation").
    *   Since the initial template doesn't define parameters, no parameter input is needed.

7.  **Tags**:
    *   Add tags for identification and management.
    *   📌 **Example:** Add a tag with key "Name" and value "CFDemo".

8.  **Review and Create**: Review the stack configuration and click "Submit" to create the stack.

9.  **Stack Creation**:
    *   CloudFormation will generate events during the stack creation process.
    *   Upon successful creation, an EC2 instance will be launched based on the template.
    *   This demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC), where code defines and manages infrastructure.

10. **Verification**:
    *   In the EC2 console, verify that the instance is running with the specified instance type (t2.micro) and AMI ID.
    *   Check the instance tags. CloudFormation automatically adds tags including the stack name, logical ID, and stack ID. The custom tag ("Name: CFDemo") is also applied.

### Updating a Stack

1.  **Initiate Update**: Select the stack and click "Update" > "Make a Direct Update".

2.  **Replace Template**: Choose to replace the existing template.

3.  **New Template File**: Select the [`1-ec2-with-sg-eip.yaml`](/resources/cloudformation/1-ec2-with-sg-eip.yaml) file. This template includes:
    *   A parameter section for the security group description.
    *   EC2 instance configuration with security groups.
    *   An Elastic IP (EIP) attached to the instance.
    *   Security group definitions for SSH (port 22) and server (port 80) access.

![CloudFormation Updating a Stack](./img/CloudFormation_updating-a-Stack.png)

4.  **Parameter Input**: Provide the required parameter value (e.g., "demo description" for the security group description).

5.  **Change Sets**:
    *   CloudFormation generates a change set to preview the changes that will be applied to the stack.
    *   The change set shows resources being added (EIP, SSH security group, server security group) and modified (EC2 instance).
    *   ⚠️ **Warning:**  Pay attention to the "Replacement" column.  If it's "True" for a resource, it will be deleted and recreated.

6.  **Submit Update**: Review the change set and submit the update.

7.  **Update Process**:
    *   CloudFormation intelligently determines the order of operations.
    *   Security groups are created first, followed by the EC2 instance update.
    *   The old EC2 instance is terminated and a new one is created.
    *   The Elastic IP is created and associated with the new EC2 instance.

8.  **Verification**:
    *   In the EC2 console, verify that a new EC2 instance is running.
    *   Check the Elastic IP console to confirm that an EIP has been created, tagged, and associated with the EC2 instance.
    *   Verify the Elastic IP address is associated with the EC2 instance in the instance's networking details.

9.  **Cleanup**: CloudFormation automatically terminates the previous EC2 instance.

10. **Resources Tab**: The "Resources" tab in CloudFormation shows all resources created and managed by the stack.

11. **Application Composer (Updated)**: View the updated architecture in Application Composer, showing the EC2 instance connected to the Elastic IP and security groups.

### Deleting a Stack

1.  **Deletion**: ⚠️ **Warning:**  Do not manually delete resources managed by CloudFormation.
2.  **Stack Deletion**: To remove all resources, select the stack and click "Delete".
3.  **Orderly Deletion**: CloudFormation will delete the resources in the correct order to ensure a clean removal.

### Conclusion

CloudFormation is a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service. It's declarative, allowing you to define the desired state of your infrastructure, and CloudFormation handles the provisioning and management. Mastering CloudFormation is a valuable skill for AWS users.

## 4. CloudFormation Service Roles and Security

CloudFormation can leverage service roles to enhance security and implement the principle of least privilege. Let's explore how they work.

### What are CloudFormation Service Roles? 🤔

CloudFormation service roles are IAM roles specifically created and dedicated to CloudFormation. They grant CloudFormation the necessary permissions to create, update, and delete stack resources on your behalf.

### Why Use Service Roles? 🛡️

Service roles are useful when you want to allow users to manage CloudFormation stacks without granting them direct permissions to the underlying resources.

📌 **Example:**
Imagine you have users who need to deploy applications using CloudFormation, but you don't want them to have full S3 or EC2 permissions. You can use a service role to grant CloudFormation the necessary permissions, while limiting the users' direct access.

### How Service Roles Work ⚙️

1.  **Define a CloudFormation Template:** This template describes the resources you want to create.
2.  **User Permissions:** The user initiating the CloudFormation stack creation needs permissions to perform actions on CloudFormation itself and, crucially, the `iam:PassRole` permission. **To create a CloudFormation stack, the user must have the `iam:PassRole` permission.**
3.  **Create a Service Role:**  This IAM role is specifically for CloudFormation and has the permissions required to create, update, and delete the resources defined in your template.  For example, it might have `s3:*Bucket` permissions.
4.  **CloudFormation Assumes the Role:** When creating the stack, the user specifies the service role. CloudFormation then assumes this role and uses its permissions to manage the stack's resources.

📌 **Example:**

Let's say a user wants to create an S3 bucket using CloudFormation.

*   The user has permissions to create CloudFormation stacks and has `iam:PassRole`.
*   A service role exists with `s3:*` permissions.
*   The user creates a CloudFormation stack and specifies the service role.
*   CloudFormation assumes the service role and creates the S3 bucket.

![CloudFormation Using a Service Role](./img/CloudFormation_using-a-Service-Role.png)

### Least Privilege Principle 🔑

Service roles help you adhere to the principle of least privilege. You avoid granting users excessive permissions by only giving them the ability to invoke a service role on CloudFormation.

### The `iam:PassRole` Permission ⚠️

For service roles to work, the user initiating the CloudFormation stack creation **must** have the `iam:PassRole` permission. This permission allows the user to pass the service role to CloudFormation.

### Demo: Creating a Service Role and Using it in CloudFormation 🚀

Here's a demonstration of creating a service role and using it within CloudFormation:

1.  **Create an IAM Role:**
    *   Go to the IAM console and navigate to the "Roles" section.
    *   Create a new role.
    *   Select "AWS service" as the trusted entity and choose "CloudFormation" as the service.
    *   Attach the necessary permission policies. 📌 **Example:** For this demo, we'll grant `AmazonS3FullAccess` to the role.
    *   Name the role something descriptive, like `DemoRoleForCFNWithS3Capabilities`.

2.  **Create a CloudFormation Stack:**
    *   Go to the CloudFormation console and create a new stack.
    *   Choose an existing template `0-just-ec2.yaml`.
    *   On the "Specify Details" page, you'll find a "Permissions" section.
    *   Select the "IAM role" option and choose the service role you created ("DemoRoleForCFNWithS3Capabilities").

📝 **Note:** If you don't specify an IAM role, CloudFormation will use your own user permissions.

⚠️ **Warning:** If the service role doesn't have the necessary permissions for all the resources in your template, the stack creation will fail. 📌 **Example:** If your template creates an EC2 instance, but your service role only has S3 permissions, the stack will fail.

### Key Takeaways 💡

*   CloudFormation service roles enhance security by allowing you to grant CloudFormation specific permissions without giving users direct access to resources.
*   The `iam:PassRole` permission is crucial for users to be able to pass a service role to CloudFormation.
*   Ensure your service role has all the necessary permissions to create, update, and delete the resources defined in your CloudFormation template.

## 6. Amazon Pinpoint

Amazon Pinpoint is a scalable inbound and outbound marketing communication service. It allows you to send messages via multiple channels:

*   📧 Email
*   💬 SMS
*   📱 Push Notifications
*   🗣️ Voice
*   ✉️ In-App Messaging

One of the primary use cases is sending SMS messages. Customers receive SMS messages sent through Amazon Pinpoint.

![Amazon Pinpoint](./img/amazon-pinpoint.png)

You can segment and personalize messages to deliver the right content to the right customers. This involves creating groups and segments. You also have the ability to receive replies. Pinpoint scales to billions of messages per day.

Use cases for Pinpoint include:

*   Running marketing campaigns by sending bulk marketing emails.
*   Sending transactional SMS messages.

When messages are sent, and events occur (e.g., text success, text delivered, replies), these events are delivered to:

*   Amazon SNS
*   Kinesis Data Firehose
*   CloudWatch Logs

This allows you to build automation on top of Amazon Pinpoint.

🤔 **What's the difference between Pinpoint, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SES?**

With SNS and SES, you manage each message's audience, content, and delivery schedule within your application. This can be a lot of work and may not be very scalable.

With Amazon Pinpoint, you create:

*   Message templates
*   Delivery schedules
*   Highly targeted segments
*   Full campaigns

All of this is managed by the Pinpoint service itself.

💡 **Tip:** Think of Pinpoint as the next evolution of SNS and SES for full-blown marketing communications services.

## 7. SSM Session Manager

SSM Session Manager allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 instances and on-premises servers without needing SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys. This enhances security by eliminating the need to open port 22 on your EC2 instances.

* **No SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys required**
* **No port 22 needed (better security)**

![SSM Session Manager](./img/ssm-session-manager.png)

### How it Works
*   The EC2 instance has an SSM Agent.
*   The SSM Agent connects to the Session Manager service.
*   Users can access the instance through the Session Manager service and execute commands.
*   Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.
*   Log data can be sent to Amazon S3 or CloudWatch Logs for enhanced security.

### Hands-On Demonstration

Let's walk through a hands-on example to illustrate how to use SSM Session Manager.

#### Launching an EC2 Instance

1.  Launch a new EC2 instance.
2.  Choose **Amazon Linux 2 AMI** and a **t2.micro** instance type.
3.  Do not use a key pair.
4.  Disable SSH traffic by configuring the security group to allow no inbound rules (no HTTP, HTTPS, or SSH).
    *   This demonstrates that we can access the instance without opening port 22.
5. In Advance details, we need to select the IAM instance profile for the instance to allow it to communicate with the SSM service.

#### Creating an IAM Role

1.  Attach an IAM instance profile to the EC2 instance to allow it to communicate with the SSM service.
2.  Create a new IAM role:
    *   Select **Amazon EC2** as the service that will use this role.
    *   Filter for **SSM** in the permissions.
    *   Choose the **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore** policy.
    *   Name the role (📌 **Example:** `DemoEC2RoleForSSM`).
    *   This role allows the EC2 instance to use the policy to communicate with the SSM service.
    *   This is necessary for the instance to be managed by the SSM service and to use the SSM Session Manager feature.
3.  Refresh the IAM role list and select the newly created role.

#### Launching the Instance

1.  Create and launch the EC2 instance.
2.  Wait for the instance to boot up.

#### Verifying in Fleet Manager

1.  Navigate to **Systems Manager** > **Fleet Manager**.
2.  Fleet Manager displays all EC2 instances registered with SSM (managed nodes).
3.  Wait for the EC2 instance to appear in Fleet Manager.
    *   It may take a few minutes for the instance to boot up and register.
4.  Once the instance appears, you can see:
    *   The SSM Agent is online.
    *   The platform (operating system).
    *   The SSM Agent version.
    *   Links to the EC2 instance.

#### Starting a Session

1.  Navigate to **Systems Manager** > **Session Manager**.
2.  Select **Start a session**.
3.  Choose the EC2 instance.
4.  Click **Start session**.
5.  A secure shell will open in your browser.
    *   You now have a secure shell without needing SSH access.
    *   📌 **Example:** You can run commands like `ping google.com` or `hostname`.
    *   The hostname will correspond to the private IP address of your instance.

```bash
ping google.com
hostname
```

### Accessing EC2 Instances: Three Methods

1.  **SSH with Port 22:** Open port 22 (from MyIP or everywhere) and use SSH keys with a terminal.
2.  **EC2 Instance Connect:** Does not require SSH keys (they are temporarily uploaded), but still requires port 22 to be open (from everywhere because will be connecting from AWS).
3.  **SSM Session Manager:** Does not require opening port 22 or using SSH keys (no inbound rules required).

### Key Requirements for Session Manager

*   Use an EC2 instance with **Amazon Linux 2**.
*   Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instance that allows access from the EC2 instance to Systems Manager (using the **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore** policy).

### Session History

*   Session history is saved as logs.
*   You can view the session history in the Session Manager console.

### Cleanup

*   Terminate the EC2 instance when you are finished.

## 8. Systems Manager Services: Run Command, Patch Manager, Maintenance Windows, and Automation

Let's explore some key services within Systems Manager. 📝 **Note:** These are important for the exam, so grasp the general idea even if you don't understand every detail.

### Run Command

![System Manager Run Command](./img/ssm-run-command.png)

The Run Command is used to execute a document (script or single command) on multiple instances using resource groups.

*   These instances can be:
    *   EC2 instances
    *   On-premises servers registered with Systems Manager (SSM Agent must be running).
*   No SSH is required. It uses the same mechanism as Session Manager, running commands through the SSM Agent.
*   Output can be sent to:
    *   Amazon S3
    *   CloudWatch Logs
*   Status notifications (in-progress, success, failed, etc.) are sent to Amazon SNS.
*   Full integration with IAM for security and CloudTrail for auditing.
*   Automation is possible: EventBridge can directly trigger a Run Command.

### Patch Manager

![Systems Manager Patch Manager](./img/ssm-patch-manager.png)

Patch Manager automates the process of patching managed instances.

*   Applies:
    *   Operating system updates
    *   Application updates
    *   Security updates
*   Supports:
    *   EC2 instances
    *   On-premises servers
    *   Linux, Mac, and Windows
*   Patching can be:
    *   On-demand
    *   Scheduled using Maintenance Windows
*   Can scan instances and generate patch compliance reports to identify missing patches.

The process involves invoking Patch Manager (using the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` Run Command) from the console, SDK, or a Maintenance Window to patch EC2 instances. Reports are then available within Patch Manager.

### Maintenance Windows

![Systems Manager Maintenance Windows](./img/ssm-maintenance-windows.png)

Maintenance Windows define a schedule for performing actions on your instances.

*   Used for tasks like:
    *   OS patching
    *   Updating drivers
    *   Installing software
*   When defining a Maintenance Window, you specify:
    1.  Schedule: When it will be triggered.

## 12. AWS Batch

AWS Batch is a fully managed batch processing service that allows you to perform batch processing at any scale. With Batch, you can efficiently run hundreds of thousands of computing batch jobs on AWS very easily.

### What is a Batch Job?

A batch job is a job that has a defined start and end time. This is in contrast to continuous or streaming jobs that run indefinitely. 📌 **Example:** A batch job might start at 1:00 AM and finish at 3:00 AM.

The Batch service dynamically launches EC2 instances or Spot Instances to accommodate the load required to run these batch jobs. Batch provisions the right amount of compute and memory for your batch queue. You simply submit or schedule batch jobs into the queue, and Batch handles the rest.

### Defining a Batch Job

A batch job is defined as a Docker image and a task definition that you run on the ECS service. This means that anything that can run on ECS can also run on Batch.

Using Batch to run batch jobs is beneficial because it automatically scales the right number of EC2 instances or Spot Instances to perform the jobs. This leads to cost optimization, and allows you to focus less on infrastructure and more on your batch jobs.

### Batch Job Workflow ⚙️

📌 **Example:** Processing images submitted by users to Amazon S3 in a batch manner.

![Batch Job Workflow - Processing images submitted by users to Amazon S3 in a batch manner](./img/Batch-Job-Workflow---Processing-images-submitted-by-users-to-Amazon-S3-in-a-batch-manner.png)

1.  An image is uploaded to Amazon S3.
2.  This upload triggers a batch job.
3.  Batch automatically manages an ECS cluster made of EC2 instances or Spot Instances.
4.  Batch ensures that you have the right amount of instances to accommodate the load of batch jobs in the queue.
5.  These instances run your Docker images to perform the job.
6.  The job might involve inserting the processed object (e.g., an image with a filter applied) into another Amazon S3 bucket.

### Batch vs. Lambda 🤔

What is the difference between Batch and Lambda? While they may seem similar, there are key differences:

**Lambda:**

*   Has a time limit of 15 minutes.
*   Supports a limited number of programming languages.
*   Has limited temporary disk space.
*   Is a serverless service.

**Batch:**

*   Has no time limit, as it relies on EC2 instances.
*   Supports any runtime that can be packaged as a Docker image.
*   Relies on the storage that comes with an EC2 instance (EBS volume or EC2 instance store), which can provide significantly more disk space.
*   Is not a serverless service; it is a managed service that relies on EC2 instances.

| Feature           | Lambda                         | Batch                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Time Limit        | 15 minutes                     | None                             |
| Runtime           | Limited programming languages  | Any (Docker image)               |
| Storage           | Limited temporary disk space   | EC2 instance storage (EBS, etc.) |
| Serverless        | Yes                            | No                               |

While Batch relies on EC2 instances, these instances are managed by AWS, so you don't have to worry about auto-scaling and other infrastructure management tasks.
