## 2. Amazon Transcribe

Amazon Transcribe automatically converts speech into text. 🗣️➡️📝 You provide an audio input, and it transcribes it into text. 📌 **Example:** Saying "Hello, my name is Stephane, and I hope you're enjoying the course" will result in that text being generated.

How does it work? It uses a deep learning process called **ASR** (Automatic Speech Recognition) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately. 🚀

Here are some key features:

*   **PII Redaction:** Automatically remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using redaction. 🛡️ This includes things like:
    *   Age
    *   Name
    *   Social Security Number
*   **Automatic Language Identification:** Supports multilingual audio. 🌐 Transcribe can recognize and transcribe audio in multiple languages (e.g., French, English, Spanish).

Use Cases:

*   Transcribing customer service calls. 📞
*   Automating closed captioning and subtitling. 📺
*   Generating metadata for media assets to create a fully searchable archive. 🗄️

Let's look at a demo:

1.  You can create a transcript and select the language (e.g., English US).
2.  Click "Start Streaming."
3.  Speak, and the audio is directly transcribed into text. 🎤➡️📝

You can also configure content removal, specifically PII identification and redaction.

📌 **Example:**

If you say, "Hello, my name is Stephane, I am 31 years old, and my phone number is 910-747-280," Transcribe can be configured to hide or redact the name and phone number:- Hello, my name is [NAME]. I am [AGE]  old, and my phone number is [PHONE]

Automatic language identification is another powerful feature. You can select multiple languages (e.g., English and French) and Transcribe will attempt to identify and transcribe in the correct language.

📌 **Example:**

Speaking in English and then switching to French will result in the transcription reflecting both languages.

```text
English: Hello, this is some recognition happening in English.
French: (Transcription of the French speech)
```

If you want to explore further, check out all the options available in the Amazon Transcribe console. 💻

## 3. Amazon Polly: Text-to-Speech with Deep Learning 🗣️

Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech using deep learning. It's essentially the opposite of transcription services. This allows you to create applications that can "talk."

📌 **Example:** Polly can take the text: "Hello, my name is Stephane and this is a demo of Amazon Polly" and generate an audio file of that text being spoken.

### Customizing Speech with Lexicons and SSML ⚙️

Amazon Polly offers powerful customization options using Lexicons and SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language).

#### Pronunciation Lexicons 📚

Pronunciation lexicons allow you to customize the pronunciation of specific words.

*   Useful for stylized words or acronyms.
*   📌 **Example:** If you have a stylized name like "Stephane" with numbers instead of letters (e.g., "St3ph4ne"), Polly might mispronounce it. You can create a lexicon to ensure it's pronounced correctly.
*   📌 **Example:** You can configure Polly to say "Amazon Web Services" instead of "A-W-S" whenever it encounters the acronym AWS.

- St3ph4ne => Stephane
- AWS => Amazon Web Services

To use lexicons:

1.  Upload your lexicon file.
2.  Use the lexicon in the `SynthesizeSpeech` operation.

### Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) ✍️

SSML provides even more granular control over how speech is generated.

*   You can emphasize specific words or phrases.
*   You can use phonetic pronunciation.
*   You can include breathing sounds or whispering effects.
*   You can even use different speaking styles, such as a Newscaster style.

Instead of plain text, you use SSML tags to control the speech.

📌 **Example:** You can insert a `<whisper>` tag to make Polly whisper a section of the text.

📝 **Note:** For pronunciation of stylized words or acronyms, use Pronunciation lexicons. For more customization like whispering or phonetic pronunciation, use SSML.

### Using Amazon Polly in the Console 💻

You can experiment with Amazon Polly directly in the AWS console.

1.  Choose a voice (including neural network voices for the most natural sound).
2.  Enter the text you want Polly to speak.

📌 **Example:**

```text
Hey, my name is Stephane and I love AWS.
```

You can also use SSML (enable it) in the console.

📌 **Example:** Adding a break:

```xml
<speak>Hey, my name is Joanna. <break time="3s"/> I will read any text you type here<speak/>.
```

This code snippet will cause Polly to pause for three seconds after saying "Hey, my name is Joanna."

To customize the pronunciation of "AWS" to "Amazon Web Services" within the console:

1.  Go to additional settings.
2.  Customize pronunciation.
3.  Apply a lexicon that maps "AWS" to "Amazon Web Services." You'll need to create and upload this lexicon file first.

💡 **Tip:** Creating a lexicon file and uploading it will automatically replace instances of "AWS" with "Amazon Web Services" in your generated speech.

## 4. Amazon Translate

Amazon Translate is a natural and accurate language translation service. 🌍 It allows you to localize content, such as websites and applications, for your international users. This service efficiently translates large volumes of text.

📌 **Example:** Let's see how a simple sentence translates into different languages:

*   English: "Hello, my name is Stephane and I'm excited to be speaking with you today."

*   French: "Bonjour, je m'appelle Stephane et je suis ravi de vous parler aujourd'hui."

*   Portuguese: "Ol , meu nome  Stephane e estou animado em falar com voc  hoje."

*   Hindi: "नमस्त , मेरा नाम स्टफन ह  और मैं आज आपके साथ बात करने के लिए उत्साहित ह ."

That's how easy it is to use Amazon Translate! 🚀

## 8. Amazon SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service designed for developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. 🚀 Unlike other managed machine learning services with specific purposes (e.g., translating text or transcribing audio), SageMaker is a higher-level service that empowers your organization's developers and data scientists to create and manage their own custom models.

Building machine learning models involves several complex steps that can be challenging to execute in a unified environment. Provisioning servers for the necessary computations can also be cumbersome. SageMaker aims to streamline this entire process.

Let's illustrate this with a simplified example:

📌 **Example:** Imagine you want to build a model to predict a student's score on a certification exam.

Here's how you might approach it:

1.  **Gather Data:** 📊 Collect data from a large number of students (e.g., 10,000) regarding their experience (years in IT, years with AWS), time spent on the course, number of practice exams taken, etc.
2.  **Label Data:** 🏷️ Assign meaning to each column of data and provide the actual exam score obtained by each student. For instance:
    *   Student A: Didn't pass (score: 670) - Didn't complete the course.
    *   Student B: Passed with a high grade (score: 990).
    *   Student C: Passed with an even higher grade (score: 934).
    The goal is to predict the score based on the collected data.
3.  **Build a Machine Learning Model:** ⚙️ Develop a model that can predict scores based on the historical data.
4.  **Train and Tune the Model:** 🎯 Refine the model over time to improve its accuracy and fit the data and desired outputs. This is often a difficult and iterative process.

SageMaker assists with all these steps: labeling, building, training, and tuning. But its capabilities extend beyond these core functions.

Once a machine learning model is created and fully operational, it needs to be deployed to make predictions on new data.

📌 **Example:** Consider a new student who provides their experience details (years in IT, AWS experience, time spent on the course). The trained machine learning model can then be applied to this new data to predict the student's potential exam score (e.g., "Based on the data, this student is predicted to pass with a score of 906").

This entire process—labeling, building, training, tuning, and deploying—can be managed within SageMaker. 🚀
