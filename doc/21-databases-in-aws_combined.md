Here's a recap of key concepts related to Amazon RDS. If you need more detailed information, refer back to the individual lectures on each topic.

Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that supports various database engines:

*   PostgreSQL
*   MySQL
*   Oracle
*   SQL Server
*   DB2
*   MariaDB
*   Custom versions of RDS

When using Amazon RDS, you need to provision:

*   RDS instance size 🖥️
*   EBS volume type and size 💾

While you provision these resources, keep in mind that auto-scaling is available for the storage layer.

To enhance read performance:

*   Amazon RDS supports **read replicas** to scale read capabilities. 🚀
    *   📌 **Example:** Use read replicas for applications running analytics against a production database.

For high availability:

*   You can use **Multi-AZ** to have a standby database. 🛡️
    *   📝 **Note:** The standby database is only for disaster recovery and cannot be used for querying.

Security is paramount:

*   IAM is used for security. 🔑
    *   You can use username/password or IAM authentication (for some database engines).
*   Security Groups provide network security. 🌐
*   KMS is used for at-rest encryption. 🔒
*   SSL/TLS provides in-transit encryption. 🚦

Backups are crucial:

*   Automated backups are available for up to 35 days. ⏱️
    *   This allows for point-in-time restores, creating a new database.
*   Manual database snapshots are used for long-term backup retention. 📸

Maintenance is managed:

*   Managed and scheduled maintenance will introduce downtime. ⏳
    *   This is necessary for database engine updates and patching the underlying EC2 instance.

IAM authentication is supported:

*   IAM authentication can be enforced through RDS Proxy. ✅
*   Integration with Secrets Manager helps manage database credentials. ⚙️

For customization:

*   If you need access to the underlying instance and customize it, use RDS Custom. 🛠️
    *   This is available for Oracle and SQL Server databases.

Use Cases:

*   Store relational databases (RDBMS). 🗄️
*   Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases. 🛒
*   Performing SQL queries and transactions. 📊

## Q & A

**An online payment company is using AWS to host its infrastructure. Due to the application’s nature, they have a strict requirement to store an accurate record of financial transactions such as credit and debit transactions. Those transactions must be stored in secured, immutable, encrypted storage which can be cryptographically verified. Which AWS service is best suited for this use case?**

### **Options:**

* 🅐 Amazon DocumentDB
* 🅑 Amazon Aurora
* 🅒 Amazon QLDB
* 🅓 Amazon Neptune

<details>

<summary>Explanation</summary>

* **Amazon QLDB** is a **ledger database** purpose-built to provide a **transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log**.
* It is **ideal for financial and regulatory applications** where **integrity and auditability** are critical.
* QLDB automatically maintains a complete and verifiable history of all changes to your data.
* **Immutability** ensures that once data is written, it cannot be altered or deleted — perfect for compliance.

#### **Why Other Options Are Not Suitable**

| Option         | Reason It's Not Ideal                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **DocumentDB** | Designed for document-based (JSON-like) data. Doesn't provide cryptographic verification or immutable storage.           |
| **Aurora**     | A relational database — great for traditional workloads, but lacks built-in immutability and cryptographic audit trails. |
| **Neptune**    | Purpose-built for graph databases (e.g., relationships and social networks), not ledgers or financial transactions.      |

✅ **Summary:**

* For **secure, immutable, cryptographically verifiable financial records**, **Amazon QLDB** is the best-fit AWS database service.

**Correct Answer:**

**Amazon QLDB (Quantum Ledger Database)** ✅ *(Correct)*
