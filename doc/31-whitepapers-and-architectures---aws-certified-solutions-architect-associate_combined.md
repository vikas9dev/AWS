## 2. AWS Well-Architected Framework

The [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) is a tool and a set of best practices designed to help you build robust and efficient applications on AWS. It's a comprehensive guide, but here's a summary of its key principles and how to use it.

**Core Principles:**

*   Stop guessing capacity needs and use auto-scaling groups.
*   Test systems at production scale. 🚀 With AWS, you can quickly spin up and tear down large infrastructures for testing. There's no excuse not to test thoroughly!
*   Automate architectural experimentation. ⚙️ Use tools like CloudFormation to easily deploy and test architectures in multiple environments.
*   Allow for evolutionary architectures. 📈 Your architecture should adapt to changing requirements. Start simple and evolve towards more advanced solutions like serverless architectures (API Gateway and Lambda).
*   Drive architecture using data. 📊 Data is crucial for informed decision-making.
*   Improve through game days. 🎮 Simulate real-world scenarios, like flash sales, to identify and address weaknesses in your architecture.

### Six Pillars of the Well-Architected Framework

1.  Operational Excellence
2.  Security
3.  Reliability
4.  Performance Efficiency
5.  Cost Optimization
6.  Sustainability

* **They are not something to balance, or trade-offs, they are a synergy**.

📝 **Note:** **You should know the names of these pillars**. They are not trade-offs but rather synergistic. Improving one pillar often benefits others. For example, improving operational excellence can lead to cost optimization.

### AWS Well-Architected Tool

The AWS Well-Architected Tool helps you review your architectures against the six pillars. It guides you in adopting architectural best practices.

**How it Works:**

1.  Select your workload.
2.  Answer questions related to the six pillars.
3.  Review your answers.
4.  Obtain advice: Access videos, documentation, and reports.
5.  View results in a dashboard.

**Using the Tool - A Practical Example:**

Go to the AWS Well-Architected Tool.

1.  **Define a Workload:**

    *   Give your workload a name (e.g., "Demo Workload," "Production Application").
    *   Specify the review owner (e.g., `john@example.com`).
    *   Indicate the environment (e.g., Production).
    *   Choose the AWS regions where your application is running (e.g., US-East-1, US-West-2).
    *   Optionally, specify non-AWS regions and account IDs.

2.  **Apply Lenses:**

    *   Lenses are sets of questions tailored to specific areas.
    *   Apply the "Well-Architected Framework Lens" for general best practices.
    *   Other lenses include:
        *   FTR (Foundational Technical Review) Lens
        *   Serverless Lens
        *   SaaS Lens
        *   You can also create custom lenses.

3.  **Start Reviewing:**

    *   Answer questions related to each of the six pillars.
    *   The tool provides resources and guidance on the right-hand side.
    *   📌 **Example:** Questions might include:
        *   "How do you determine your priorities?"
        *   "How do you structure your organization?"

4.  **Analyze Risks and Recommendations:**

    *   After answering questions, the tool identifies high, medium, and low risks.
    *   Click on a lens to see an overview of the risks.
    *   Select a specific risk to view recommendations.
    *   The tool provides links to relevant sections of the Well-Architected Framework for detailed guidance.
    *   📌 **Example:** A high-risk finding might recommend that you "evaluate internal customer needs" or "evaluate the threat landscape."

5.  **Improve and Iterate:**

    *   Address the identified risks by implementing the recommended actions.
    *   Define milestones to track your progress.
    *   Continuously review and improve your architecture.

By using the AWS Well-Architected Tool and following the framework's principles, you can build applications that are:

*   Production-ready
*   Compliant
*   Well-architected

## 3. AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor is a service that provides a high-level assessment of your AWS account. You don't need to install anything to use it. It checks various aspects of your account and offers recommendations.

Trusted Advisor checks for things like:

*   EBS Public Snapshots
*   RDS Public Snapshots
*   Usage of the root account

These checks are grouped into six categories:

*   Cost optimization
*   Performance
*   Security
*   Fault tolerance
*   Service limits
*   Operational excellence

There are two sets of checks:

1.  Core set of checks
2.  Full set of checks

To access the full set of checks, you need a Business or Enterprise Support plan. 💰

With a Business or Enterprise Support plan, you also gain programmatic access to Trusted Advisor through the AWS Support API. 💻

Trusted Advisor provides recommendations based on its findings. For example, it might highlight security issues like:

*   S3 buckets allowing global access 🔓
*   Security group rules allowing unrestricted access to specific ports 🚪

📌 **Example:**

Trusted Advisor might flag that one of your S3 buckets is allowing global access and that 29 of your 60 security group rules allow unrestricted access to a specific port. You should verify these findings to ensure they align with your intentions.

To access all checks, you may be prompted to upgrade your support plan. ⬆️

Recommendation categories include:

*   Cost Optimization
*   Performance
*   Fault Tolerance
*   Operational Excellence
*   Security
*   Service Limits

With a basic support plan, you primarily have access to security checks. 🛡️

These core security checks include:

*   Bucket Permissions
*   Security Group ports
*   EBS Public Snapshots
*   RDS Public Snapshots

More advanced security checks require a higher support plan.

You can also view service limits directly within Trusted Advisor. This allows you to monitor:

*   Auto Scaling Groups
*   CloudFormation Stacks
*   DynamoDB Read and Write Capacity

📝 **Note:**

Trusted Advisor's usefulness is limited without a paid support plan. However, understanding its functionality is important for AWS certification exams. 📚
