# AWS RDS, Aurora & ElastiCache - Handnote 📝

## 🗄️ AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)

### What is RDS?
- **Managed relational database service** that automates database administration tasks
- **Supports multiple database engines** with automated backups, patching, and monitoring

### Supported Engines
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- IBM DB2
- **Aurora** (AWS proprietary)

### Why Use RDS?
- ✅ Fully automated provisioning
- ✅ Automated OS patching
- ✅ Continuous backups with Point-in-Time Restore
- ✅ Monitoring dashboards
- ✅ Read replicas (up to 15) - A single primary DB instance can have a maximum of 15 read replicas in total — across all Availability Zones and all Regions combined. RDS read replicas are capped at 15 per primary DB instance globally (all AZs + Regions combined).
- ✅ Multi-AZ for disaster recovery
- ✅ Maintenance windows
- ✅ Vertical & horizontal scaling
- ✅ Storage backed by EBS
- ⚠️ **Cannot SSH** into RDS instances

### RDS Storage Auto Scaling
- ✅ Automatically scales storage when running out of space
- ✅ Triggers when:
  - Free storage < 10% of allocated
  - Condition lasts > 5 minutes
  - 6 hours passed since last modification
- ✅ Set **maximum storage threshold**

## 📚 READ REPLICAS vs MULTI-AZ

### Read Replicas
- **Purpose**: **Scale read operations**
- **Up to 15 replicas**
- **Same AZ, different AZ, or different regions**
- **Asynchronous replication** (eventually consistent)
- ✅ Can be **promoted** to standalone database
- ✅ **Free** replication within same region, different AZs
- ⚠️ **Cross-region replication** incurs network costs
- ⚠️ **Only for SELECT** (read operations)

### Use Cases
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Offload read-heavy workloads
- **Read scaling**: Distribute read traffic

### Multi-AZ (Disaster Recovery)
- **Purpose**: **Disaster recovery** (NOT read scaling)
- **Synchronous replication** to standby in different AZ
- **Single DNS name** (automatic failover)
- **Failover time**: ~60 seconds
- ⚠️ **Standby is NOT used for reads** (failover only)
- ✅ **Zero-downtime** conversion from Single-AZ to Multi-AZ

### Important Note
- ✅ **Read Replicas CAN be Multi-AZ** for DR
- ⚠️ **Common exam question**

## 🚀 AMAZON AURORA

### What is Aurora?
- **AWS-proprietary database engine** compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL
- **Cloud-native design** with automatic scaling, self-healing storage, and high performance

### Performance
- 🚀 **5x faster** than MySQL on RDS
- 🚀 **3x faster** than Postgres on RDS
- **20% more expensive** than RDS (but often cost-effective at scale)

### Storage
- ✅ **Auto-expands**: 10GB → 128TB
- ✅ **6 copies** across 3 AZs
- ✅ **4/6 copies** required for writes
- ✅ **3/6 copies** required for reads
- ✅ **Self-healing** (peer-to-peer replication)
- ✅ **Data distributed** across hundreds of volumes

### High Availability
- ✅ **Up to 15 read replicas** - Aurora supports 1 writer + up to 15 read replicas **per cluster**, and those replicas can be distributed across multiple AZs — but the limit applies per cluster, not across Regions.
- ✅ **Sub-10ms replication lag**
- ✅ **<30 second failover** (faster than Multi-AZ MySQL)
- ✅ **Any read replica can become master**

### Aurora Endpoints
- **Writer Endpoint**: Always points to master (writes)
- **Reader Endpoint**: Load balances across read replicas (reads)
- **Custom Endpoints**: Subset of instances for specific workloads

### Aurora Features
- ✅ **Backtrack**: Restore to any point in time (no backups needed)
- ✅ **Replica Auto-Scaling**: Automatically scale read replicas (1-15)
- ✅ **Serverless**: Auto-scaling based on usage (pay per second)
- ✅ **Global Aurora**: Cross-region replication (<1 second lag)
- ✅ **Machine Learning**: Integrate with SageMaker, Comprehend
- ✅ **Babelfish**: Aurora PostgreSQL understands T-SQL (SQL Server migration)

### Global Aurora
- **Primary region**: Read/write
- **Up to 5 secondary regions**: Read-only
- **<1 second replication lag**
- **RTO <1 minute** for failover
- **Up to 16 read replicas** per secondary region

Aurora Global Database (Multi-Region)
* 1 **Primary Region**
  * 1 writer + up to 15 readers
* Each **Secondary Region**
  * **Read-only cluster**
  * Up to **16 readers per Region**

## 💾 RDS & AURORA BACKUPS

### RDS Automated Backups
- ✅ **Daily full backup** during backup window
- ✅ **Transaction logs** backed up every 5 minutes
- ✅ **Point-in-Time Restore** (up to 5 minutes ago)
- ✅ **Retention**: 1-35 days (configurable)
- ⚠️ **Set to 0 to disable**

### RDS Manual Snapshots
- ✅ **Manually triggered**
- ✅ **Retained indefinitely**
- ✅ **Cost-saving tip**: Snapshot & delete instead of stopping RDS

### Aurora Backups
- ✅ **Similar to RDS** (1-35 days retention)
- ⚠️ **Cannot disable** automated backups
- ✅ **Point-in-Time Restore** available
- ✅ **Manual snapshots** supported

### Restore Options
- ✅ Always creates **new database instance**
- ✅ **MySQL RDS**: Restore from S3 backup
- ✅ **Aurora MySQL**: Restore from S3 using **Percona XtraBackup**

### Aurora Database Cloning
- ✅ **Fast cloning** (seconds, not hours)
- ✅ **Point-in-time copy** of database
- ✅ **Independent** from source (changes don't affect each other)
- ✅ **Cost-effective** for testing

- ✅ **Encrypt snapshots** if source encrypted

### Network Security
- ✅ **VPC**: Deploy in private subnets
- ✅ **Security Groups**: Control access - Both Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora run in a VPC and are protected by Security Groups.
